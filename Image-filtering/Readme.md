## Image filtering: Mean & Median filters
In this section, I describe two types of filters and show code is written by myself. The main goal is to realize my own filters, donâ€™t using the popular libraries. I will try to explain how it works and show you how filters reduce noise from images. 

All explanation you can find in my article on Medium.
